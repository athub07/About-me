<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi, I'm Aviraj, a 19-year-old student with an insatiable curiosity for science. I’m currently pursuing my studies with computer science through Python, web development, and data structures. For me, learning is not just about grades—it's about understanding how the universe works, whether that's through equations, molecules, or galaxies.

When I'm not studying, you'll probably find me with a book in hand. I'm a huge fan of authors like Carl Sagan, Brian Greene, and Stephen Hawking, and books like Cosmos have shaped the way I see the world. </p>

<p>I also enjoy literature and classic novels, as they help me sharpen my English while offering fresh perspectives on life.

I'm also committed to fitness and health. Over the past months, I've built a consistent workout routine at the gym, focusing on strength training, cardio, and core exercises. Alongside, I keep an eye on nutrition—experimenting with intermittent fasting, mindful eating, and natural foods. My goal is a toned, healthy body that matches the discipline. </p>

Technology excites me just as much as science. I'm steadily learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend tools, aiming to grow into a full-stack developer. I believe coding, like science, is about solving problems and building systems that make sense of complexity.

<p>Beyond academics and self-growth, I enjoy chess, sitcoms like Friends, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Modern Family, and meaningful conversations with people who inspire me. My elder sister has been my biggest role model, and recently I've found motivation in new friendships that push me to grow further.</p>

In essence, I'm someone who thrives on knowledge, discipline, and curiosity—whether that's in the lab, the library, the gym, or even in everyday life. My dream is to pursue higher studies abroad, likely in Germany, and build a future where my love for science and technology creates real impact.</p>
